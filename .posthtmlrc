The crowd size at games has surged, particularly after the 2021-22 season, when women’s basketball made its deepest postseason run in program history. The season after, the Lions continued to improve, not only breaking their own postseason record but making history for the Ivy League as well. In that season, average attendance numbers broke 1,000 for the first time since Columbia Athletics began tracking attendance data."

The highest-attended game in program history took place last year when Columbia faced off against Princeton, a game which had been much anticipated due to the hype behind both teams. These attendance records are proof of the interest behind a team with winning momentum—fans show up to be a part of a moment bigger than themselves."

The ticketing department is able to track and identify individuals who attend multiple games, including what kind of ticket they purchase. From there, the department is able to reach out and offer a range of ticket packages, from courtside season tickets to discounted packages for local groups.

Courtside, spectators gathered for intense discussions. With 1,098 people in attendance, the showing wasn’t the biggest the Lions had seen this season—still, the sense of community was palpable."
